# F20DL

Chosen dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arianazmoudeh/airbnbopendata
  
Reasons for choosing this set:  
-Interesting fields could be used to make interesting observations/predictions  
-Good spread of data in several columns  
-Variety of data types opens the door to potentially more challenging work  
-Large amount of data in set  
  
  
Notes/stuff to look into  
-maybe change Q5 histogram to compare data that makes more sense  
-annoyingly the kaggle description mentions stuff like number of rooms, but they arent in the actual dataset sooo  
-what is review_rate_number? the kaggle desc doesnt mention it
